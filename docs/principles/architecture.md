## Architectural Principles for MidJournal App

These principles guide the design and development of the MidJournal application, ensuring a robust, scalable, maintainable, and secure system.

### 1. Abstraction Principle

**Definition:** Separate the "what" from the "how." Core functionalities should define clear interfaces, allowing different implementations to be swapped out without affecting the rest of the system. This promotes flexibility and testability.
**Application:** Services like `LLMInferenceService`, `TextToSpeechService`, `OCRService`, `ImageGenerationService`, and `DocumentParserService` will be defined as interfaces, allowing for various underlying technologies (e.g., different LLM providers, open-source TTS engines) to be integrated or changed with minimal disruption.

### 2. Modularity Principle

**Definition:** Break down the system into small, independent, and interchangeable modules or services. Each module should have a single, well-defined responsibility.
**Application:** The backend will be organized into distinct modules (e.g., `ingestion/`, `query/`, `journal/`, `analysis/`, `image_gen/`, `custom_insights/`), each with its own service logic, routers, and consumers. The monorepo structure further reinforces this by separating `apps/backend` and `apps/frontend` and creating `packages/` for shared code.

### 3. Asynchronous Processing Principle

**Definition:** Utilize non-blocking operations and message queues for long-running or non-real-time tasks to improve responsiveness and scalability.
**Application:** Heavy operations like document ingestion, LLM-based journal analysis, and image generation will be offloaded to message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, SQS). FastAPI endpoints will quickly acknowledge requests and queue tasks for background consumers.

### 4. Data Siloing Principle

**Definition:** Strictly isolate user data. Each user's data should be logically (and where feasible, physically) separated and only accessible by that specific user.
**Application:** All database queries, vector store operations, and file storage will include `user_id` as a primary filtering criterion. Access control mechanisms will be rigorously applied to prevent cross-user data exposure.

### 5. Observability Principle

**Definition:** Design the system to provide deep insights into its internal state through metrics, logs, and traces, enabling effective monitoring, debugging, and performance analysis.
**Application:** Services will be instrumented with detailed metrics (Prometheus/Grafana), structured logging (ELK stack), and distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry/Jaeger). Alerts will be configured for critical events and performance deviations.

### 6. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Principle

**Definition:** Manage and provision infrastructure using code and automated processes, rather than manual configurations.
**Application:** Pulumi will be used to define and manage all cloud infrastructure (e.g., serverless functions, databases, message queues, storage buckets, API Gateway, IAM policies). This ensures consistency, repeatability, and version control of the infrastructure.

### 7. Monorepo Best Practices

**Definition:** Manage multiple, distinct projects within a single version-controlled repository, leveraging tools to ensure efficient development, consistent tooling, and clear dependency management.
**Application:** The project is structured with `apps/` for primary applications (`backend`, `frontend`) and `packages/` for shared code (`api-client`, `e2e-tests`). Tools like Turborepo and `pnpm` will be used for efficient task running, caching, and dependency management across the workspace.
