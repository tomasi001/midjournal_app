# Phase 2 Progress: Frontend and Monorepo Environment Setup

This document outlines the work completed during Phase 2, which focused on initializing the frontend application and creating a stable, unified development environment for the entire monorepo.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Frontend Application Scaffolding

- A new Next.js application was created in the `apps/frontend` directory.
- The frontend stack was initialized with Tailwind CSS for styling and `shadcn/ui` for the component library.

### 2. Unified Development Environment

- The project was configured to use `pnpm` as the package manager and `Turborepo` as the monorepo orchestrator.
- A single `pnpm dev` command was implemented at the project root to start all services in parallel:
  - It launches the backend services (API, database, message queue, etc.) via `docker-compose`.
  - It starts the Next.js frontend development server.
- This was achieved by adding a `dev` script to `apps/backend/package.json` that correctly changes directory to the root before running `docker-compose`.

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline Stabilization

- The backend's linting pipeline was significantly improved by migrating from `flake8` and `black` to `Ruff`, a modern, high-performance linter and formatter.
- A series of complex script execution issues between `pnpm`, `Turborepo`, and `Poetry` were debugged and resolved.
  - The final solution involves using `pre*` scripts (e.g., `prelint`) in `apps/backend/package.json` to run `poetry install --no-root` before a script executes, ensuring the Python environment is always correctly configured.
- All existing linting errors in the backend codebase were corrected using `ruff --fix`.

### 4. Documentation and DX Improvements

- The root `README.md` was updated to reflect the new monorepo structure and provide clear, simple instructions for setup and development.
- Explicit `install` scripts and detailed explanations for all major `pnpm` commands (`dev`, `lint`, `build`, `test`) were added.
- Instructions on how to target specific workspaces using the `pnpm --filter` flag were included to improve the developer experience.

## Outcome

Phase 2 concludes with a fully functional, integrated monorepo development environment. Both backend and frontend applications can be developed and managed concurrently. The CI pipelines are stable, and the project is well-documented, providing a solid foundation for future feature development.
